# Track It fitness app

## Vision Statement
The Track It Application allows for people to efficiently track their weight, see changes in their physique, and aid in losing and/or gaining weight.

## What is Track It?
Track It is a mobile application (available for both android and ios users) that allows for its users to track their weight by prompting the user for their body weight in either kilograms or pounds. The application then calculates changes in their body weight by averaging their body weight every week. Furthermore, the application generates a timeline of all the weights that they have provided. The user is then given an option to see weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, half a year, and yearly trends of their body weight. In addition, the user can optionally attach an image every time they provide the application their body weight. As a result it allows for the users to not only track their weight, but also see changes in their body. Moreover, Track It gives the user an ability to add a goal of hitting a specific body weight. The application then provides the user a reminder of how much pounds/kilograms left they need to lose or gain. In addition, the user can provide the application how much pounds/kilograms they intend to gain or lose in a week. The application then calculates a rough date to when the user can achieve their goal given the rate of change in their body weight

## Who can use it?
Track It is most beneficial to individuals that need a reliable tool to track their weight such as people that are trying to lose or gain weight, or athletes that need to pay attention to their weight.

## Why use Track It?
Track It provides a more efficient way of tracking body weight. The application provides its users trends in various time lengths which is a much more reliable way of tracking weight in contrast to just eyeing body weight in a day-to-day manner. Furthermore, the user can see changes in their bodies by seeing various images of their bodies at different times. In addition, the application provides the user a clear user interface that will feel more organic and easy to use compared to other weight tracking applications such as MyFitnessPal. The application also stores every information that the user has provided the application previously letting the user track their progress anywhere and at any time.

## Success Criteria
